Copy the JOS file for your system onto your computer
and run ./JOS (case sensitive) (or double click JOS.exe on Windows) to run JOS.
It will not over-write your current system
or install anything new. It will just
serve as a shell to run commands. You
can still run any program you have installed
through the run command, if you know the 
file path. It will run the program, and
when it exits it will return to JOS. To 
exit, type exit.

Have fun!
