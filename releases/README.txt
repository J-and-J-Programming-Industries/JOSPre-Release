You must habe a Linux system to run this
until I make a Windows version.

Copy the JOS file onto your Linux system
and run ./JOS (case sensitive) to run JOS.
It will not over-write your current system
or install anything new. It will just
serve as a shell to run commands. You
can still run any Linux program you have
through the run command, if you know the 
file path. It will run the program, and
when it exits it will return to JOS. To 
exit, type exit.

Have fun!
